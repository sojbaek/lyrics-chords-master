1. You came when I was happy in your sunshine,
                   D7                G
I grew to love you more each passing day.
                                  D
Before too long I built my world around you,
      Em                A               D
and I prayed you'd love enough of me to stay.
 
       G                         D
If you love me let me know, if you don't then let me go,
        A                        D
I can't take another minute of a day without you in it.
D7     G                         D
If you love me let it be, if you don't then set me free,
         A                A7             G D
take the chains away that keep me loving y...ou.

2.The arms that open wide to hold me closer,
                         D7                 A
the hands that run their fingers through my hair.
    G                                     D
The smile that says, "Hello, it's good to see you!"
  Em           A                  A7
Anytime I turn around to find you there.
 
        D
3. It's this and so much more that makes me love you,
                D7             G
what else can I do to make you see.
                                     D
You know you have whatever's mine to give you,
      Em              A             D
but a love affair for one can never be.
 
       G                         D
If you love me let me know, if you don't then let me go,
        A                        D
I can't take another minute of a day without you in it.
D7     G                         D
If you love me let it be, if you don't then set me free,
         A                A7             G D
take the chains away that keep me loving y...ou.
 
             A                 A7             G           D
oh, take the chains away, that keep me loving you, loving you.
